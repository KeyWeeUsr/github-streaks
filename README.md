github-streaks
==============

This is a Firefox addon which adds back in GitHub streaks.

I found the motivating factor of streaks helpful in keeping up my contributions
and work on personal projects for the few months before GitHub removed them, so
I decided to put them back in!

You can install this from source if you want, or from the Mozilla add-on site:
